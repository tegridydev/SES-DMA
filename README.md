# Title: 
SES-DMA: A Self-Evolving System with Dynamic Memory Architecture for Distributed Multi-Agent Learning

## Abstract:
This paper presents a novel architecture for distributed learning systems that combines mixture of peers (MoP) methodology with dynamic memory allocation and self-evolution capabilities. The SES-DMA system introduces a unique approach to managing distributed learning agents while maintaining system-wide knowledge coherence and progressive learning capabilities. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness through empirical evaluation across multiple learning tasks and computational environments.

## Research Questions:
1. How does the MoP architecture affect the system's learning efficiency compared to traditional single-agent systems?
2. What is the impact of dynamic memory architecture on knowledge retention and retrieval?
3. How does the self-evolution mechanism contribute to system adaptation and performance improvement?
4. What are the scalability characteristics of the SES-DMA system under varying load conditions?
5. How does the system maintain consistency across distributed agents while allowing for specialized learning?

## Hypotheses:
H1: The MoP architecture provides superior learning performance compared to single-agent systems due to specialized agent roles and collaborative learning.

H2: Dynamic memory architecture significantly improves knowledge retention and retrieval efficiency compared to static memory systems.

H3: Self-evolution mechanisms lead to measurable improvements in system performance over time without human intervention.

H4: The distributed nature of SES-DMA provides linear scalability up to a certain threshold of computational resources.
